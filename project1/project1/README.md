# Project 1
In this project I designed a book review website.
This website has 4/5 webpages:
The home page contains a some sort of slogan and a button that redirects to the sign up page.
The sign up age contains a form that allows a user to create their account. When the account has been created the user is redirect to the login page. (form has no input validation)
The log in page contains a fomr that allows a user to log in using their account credentials. 
If the credentials are incorrect the user will be sent back to the login page with an error message prompting the, to try again.
If the user manages to log in they are redirected to a page that allows them to search for a book using a small form. If no book has been found a message will be displayed that says so.
If matching books were found, a list of all the matching books will be displayed (in the same page), each book in the list has a link that directs to a page that displays more info about it.
Each book page has the all the info regarding a book (including some stats from goodreads.com), including all the reviews associated with the book, in this page users can write ONLY 1 review about the book. 
Book reviews can be written and submittged trough a form.
A user can make an API request of a book. If the book requested was found a JSON response will be returned, else a 404 error will.
